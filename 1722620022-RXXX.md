# Confinement(Golang concurency)

There are operations that are implicitly concurrency safe with in multiple concurrent processes these are:

1. Immutable Data
2. Confinement

- It is a method for ensuring information is only ever available from only one concurrent process.
- It makes concurrent program implicitly save and no sychronization is needed.
- There are two types:
  1. Ad hoc
  2. Lexical

## 1. Ad hoc Confinement

- This is achieved through agreement(convention) and it is really easy for ignoring this kind of conventions and confinement
- Since sticking to conventions can be hard specially for large projects it will require static analysis of code everytime before commiting the code to the code base.

## 2. Lexical Confinement

- This makes the compiler to inforce the rules "it wields the compiler to
  enforce the confinement."
- Involves using Lexical scope to expose only the correct data and concurrency promitves for multiple concurrent processes to use
- Makes it impossible to do the wrong thing
- I think this is also easy to do in go since we have Readonly or Writeonly channels
- It can also achieved by dividing the data for the goroutines

* So whatâ€™s the point? Why pursue confinement if we have synchronization available to us? The answer is improved performance and reduced cognitive load on developers.

**NOTE:** Concurrent code that utilizes lexical confinement also has the benefit of usually being simpler to understand than concurrent code without lexically confined variables.
