# Generative AI Workshop

## Prompt Engineering

This is the way that you will talk with LLMs

* **Clarity** solves any problems

### Prompt Structure
1. **Role**: Define the role of the LLM. 
   - Example: "You are a data analyst."
2. **Task**: Specify the task to be performed.
   - Example: "Analyze the sales data from the past year."
3. **Directions**:
    - **Specifics**: Provide detailed instructions.
      - Example: "Focus on identifying trends in monthly sales."
    - **Steps**: Outline the steps to complete the task.
      - Example: "1. Clean the data. 2. Generate monthly sales summaries. 3. Identify the top three trends."
    - **Dos and Don'ts**:
      - Example: "Do: Use visualizations. Don't: Ignore missing data."
4. **Output format**: Describe the desired format of the response.
   - Example: "Provide a summary report in Markdown format."
5. **Examples**: Providing good examples creates a good response; give as many examples as you can for the LLM.
   - Example: "Here is an example of a trend analysis report: ..."
6. **Input Data**: Include any necessary input data.
   - Example: "Here is the sales data: [link to data]"

> The more specific you are, the better the response of the LLM will be.

* If you give good instructions for the LLM, the results can be given to another LLM to generate additional prompts and resources.

**Temperature**: This parameter determines how creative the LLM should be, e.g., `0.9` for being creative.

**The Output Format**: This really determines the way that the LLM gives the response for your prompt.

You can use backticks (') when you want to provide something that is quoted and should be used with the LLM.

## Analysis

- You can use the LLM for making many different analyses for various purposes. For making these kinds of things, we need to have a really, really good prompt.

### Analysis Prompt Template

1. **Role**: You are a data analyst.
2. **Task**: Perform an analysis on the given dataset to identify key insights.
3. **Directions**:
    - **Specifics**: Focus on uncovering trends and outliers.
    - **Steps**:
      1. Clean the dataset.
      2. Generate summary statistics.
      3. Identify trends and outliers.
      4. Provide visualizations where applicable.
    - **Dos and Don'ts**:
      - Do: Ensure accuracy of the data analysis.
      - Don't: Ignore any data points without justification.
4. **Output format**: Provide a detailed report in PDF format.
5. **Examples**: Here is an example of an analysis report: [link to example report]
6. **Input Data**: Here is the dataset: [link to dataset]

## Entity Extraction

- This is an awesome way of using LLMs, especially in Software Engineering, because extracting entities from a paragraph or document can be very useful.

### Entity Extraction Prompt Template

1. **Role**: You are an entity extraction specialist.
2. **Task**: Extract entities from the provided text.
3. **Directions**:
    - **Specifics**: Focus on extracting named entities such as people, organizations, locations, and dates.
    - **Steps**:
      1. Read the text carefully.
      2. Identify and extract named entities.
      3. Categorize the entities by type.
    - **Dos and Don'ts**:
      - Do: Ensure all relevant entities are extracted.
      - Don't: Include irrelevant information.
4. **Output format**: Provide a JSON object with the extracted entities.
5. **Examples**: Here is an example of extracted entities: 
   ```json
   {
     "people": ["John Doe", "Jane Smith"],
     "organizations": ["OpenAI", "Google"],
     "locations": ["New York", "San Francisco"],
     "dates": ["2024-07-26", "2024-07-27"]
   }  
   ```
  
## Transformation

- You can use the LLM for making a translation from one language (including programming languages) to another.

### Transformation Prompt Template

1. **Role**: You are a translator.
2. **Task**: Translate the provided content from the source language to the target language.
3. **Directions**:
    - **Specifics**: Ensure the translation is accurate and retains the original meaning.
    - **Steps**:
      1. Read the source content carefully.
      2. Translate the content into the target language.
      3. Review the translation for accuracy and clarity.
    - **Dos and Don'ts**:
      - Do: Maintain the original context and meaning.
      - Don't: Omit or add information that changes the meaning.
4. **Output format**: Provide the translation in a text file.
5. **Examples**: Here is an example of a translation: 
   - Source: "Hello, how are you?"
   - Target: "Hola, ¿cómo estás?"
6. **Input Data**: Here is the content to be translated: [link to content]

> There is also a good site for deploying python Apps [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)  

## Inference

- You can use the LLM to make inferences based on the provided data or context.

### Inference Prompt Template

1. **Role**: You are an inference engine.
2. **Task**: Make inferences based on the provided data or context.
3. **Directions**:
    - **Specifics**: Ensure the inferences are logical and based on the provided data.
    - **Steps**:
      1. Review the provided data or context carefully.
      2. Identify patterns or relevant information.
      3. Formulate inferences based on the identified patterns.
      4. Validate the inferences to ensure they are logical.
    - **Dos and Don'ts**:
      - Do: Provide clear and concise inferences.
      - Don't: Make assumptions without evidence.
4. **Output format**: Provide the inferences in a structured format, such as a list or a report.
5. **Examples**: Here is an example of inferences based on data:
   - Data: "The company has had increasing sales for the past three quarters."
   - Inference: "The company is likely experiencing a period of growth."
6. **Input Data**: Here is the data for making inferences: [link to data]
