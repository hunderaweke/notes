# Writing HTTP Services with go
## The `NewServer` constructor
This makes a `http.Handler`
- NewServer is a big constructor that takes in all dependencies as arguments
- It returns an http.Handler if possible, which can be a dedicated type for more complex situations
- It usually configures its own muxer and calls out to `routes.go`

## Map the entire API surface in routes.go
- Always make the routes in one file and place possible
## `func main()` only calls `run()`
- This is really good for keeping the `main()` function simple and easy for debugging
- Running your tests will be cool using `t.Parallel()` Since there will be on interference among the instances of the function that is being tested
