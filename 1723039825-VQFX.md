# Clean archirecture

- We have this kind of in circling from the bottom to up
### The dependency Rule:
- This is a rule that prevents the dependency going outward from the circle and only we should take on account the dependency to the inner part of the circle
- This rule says that source code dependencies can only point inwards. Nothing in an inner circle can know anything at all about something in an outer circle. In particular, the name of something declared in an outer circle must not be mentioned by the code in the an inner circle. 
- Everything in the outer part of the archirecture shouldn't be mentioned by the inner part. Which means the inner part should be independent of the outer part of the project.

### 1. Entities
- Encapsulate the Enterprise wide business rules. If there is no Enterprise level thing in your project these are the objects that u will use for the project as a whole.
- They encapsulate the most general and high-level rules. They are the least likely to change when something external changes. 
- **NOTE**: No operational change to any particular application should affect the entity layer.


## 2. Use Cases
- This layer implements all the usecases of the application. Which means basically the data operations.
-  These use cases orchestrate the flow of data to and from the entities, and direct those entities to use their enterprise wide business rules to achieve the goals of the use case.
- If the usecases of the application change the code in this layer will be affected too.


## 3. Controller,Presenters,Gateways(Interface Adapters)
-  This layer is a set of adapters that convert data from the format most convenient for the use cases and entities, to the format most convenient for some external agency such as the Database or the Web. 
- The models are likely just data structures that are passed from the controllers to the use cases, and then back from the use cases to the presenters and views.
- No code inward of this circle should know anything at all about the database. If the database is a SQL database, then all the SQL should be restricted to this layer, and in particular to the parts of this layer that have to do with the database.


## 4. Devices,Web,DB,External Interfaces(Frameworks and Drivers)
- This is the place that we give access to the external interfaces and drives and also the user side UI. There is not a lot coding here just glueing the existing code. 

**NOTE**:The level of the layers and the level of isolation depends on the kind of project that u are trying to build and the requirements of the application that u are working on may be u need less or more of these three layers for ur application. But always you should follow the [Dependency rule]. 


- If you are worried about the inner circle calling a thing that could only exist in the outer circle You can use interfaces for making the abstraction in the inner circle and let the outer circle implement them for the concrete implementation but remember nothing from the outside should be a dependency for inside circles
- The data that will go from layer to layer should be some simple data structure that is accessible in the inner circle with no need of external processing these can be simple structs or list or other thing but be sure they are not going from the outside to the inside which forces the inner circle to know something about the outer circle. We donâ€™t want the data structures to have any kind of dependency that violates The Dependency Rule.
