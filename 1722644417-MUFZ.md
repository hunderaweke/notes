# Preventing Goroutine Leaks

Since Goroutines are not garbage collected we need to ensure that they are not left over in the system
The goroutine has a few paths to ter mination:

- When it has completed its work.
- When it cannot continue its work due to an unrecoverable error.
- When itâ€™s told to stop working.

Since the Goroutines doesn't have any idea of the context that they are called in a parent goroutine should be able to tell them and close them based on the context. One way of acheiving that in go is to pass a channel to a goroutine(by convention it is called `done`) and closing that channel when we want to terminate the goroutine we started running in background
**Example:**

```go
doWork := func(
	done <-chan interface{},
	strings <-chan string,
) <-chan interface{} {
	terminated := make(chan interface{})
	go func() {
		defer fmt.Println("doWork exited.")
		defer close(terminated)
		for {
			select {
			case s := <-strings:
				fmt.Println(s)
			case <-done:
				return
			}
		}
	}()
	return terminated
}
done := make(chan interface{})
terminated := doWork(done, nil)
go func() {
	// Cancel the operation after 1 second.
	time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
	fmt.Println("Canceling doWork goroutine...")
	close(done)
}()
<-terminated
fmt.Println("Done.")
```

- We can utilize the same technique for Readonly also since there gonna be no difference

**Example:**

```go
newRandStream := func(done <-chan interface{}) <-chan interface{} {
	randStream := make(chan interface{})
	go func() {
		defer fmt.Println("newRandStream closure close")
		defer close(randStream)
		for {
			select {
			case randStream <- rand.Int():
			case <-done:
				return
			}
		}
	}()
	return randStream
}
done := make(chan interface{})
randStream := newRandStream(done)
fmt.Println("3 outputs here")
for i := range 3 {
	fmt.Printf("%v: %v\n", i, <-randStream)
}
close(done)
time.Sleep(time.Second)

```

- For this Example if we omit closing the done channel the goroutine is gonna run forever and it will produce a memory leak to our code.

**NOTE:** Since memory leaks are critical code issues we should be sure to close the Goroutines because when the number of Goroutines grow large it can even crash the programs that we are running

***If a goroutine is responsible for creating a goroutine, it is also responsible for ensuring it can stop the goroutine***
